<h2>XOR Encoding and Decoding</h2>

The first time I tried the encryption, it did not work because I made an error while converting to hex. When I attempted to decrypt the message, the decryption gave me an unexpected result which forced me to go bck and check my work for the mistake.

While trying to input the image of my flowchart into github, I was not able to do so. I followed the strategies demonstrated by the earlier assignment but this gave me some trouble initially.

<h2>Strategies for when the key and message are different lengths</h2>

When the key and message are different lengths, the key can be repeated multiple times in order to reach the length of the message. In the example I used, my message was "think" but if my key had been a shorter length, like "key," I would have repeated the letters in the key in order to reach the length of the message. In this case my message would have remained "think," but my key would have become "keyke."
